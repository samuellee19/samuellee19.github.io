summary: This project expands upon Robert Culkin’s and Sanjiv R. Das’ effort to recreate the Black-Scholes option pricing model using Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) algorithm. Hence, the project utilizes real data scraped from `Yahoo Finance` and `Alpha Query` to observe a robustness of the model in real-life situation.
